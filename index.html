    <h3>Well guess what :</h3>

    <p>You are about to begin coding as a "<strong>script-kiddie</strong>".<br />
    <figure><figcaption>Websites deployment is a 3 steps process :</figcaption>
    <ol>
       	<li>do a page on <a href="https://txti.es">txti.es</a> and save it as "index.html" somewhere, and we will call the location you saved it as [path].</li>
       	<li>create an account on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> + intiate a repository + enable githubpages when initiating.</li>
       	<li>Type lines below starting by "$" in a <strong>linux terminal</strong> or a <strong>windows powershell</strong>.<br />
       	Lines without "$" are commands outputs.<br />

<hr>
        	<code>
        	$ cd ~<br />
        	$ git clone https://[user].github.com/[repo]<br />
        	clonning..<br />
        	OK!<br />
        	$ cd [repo]<br />
        	$ pwd<br />

    <p>Now visit https://[user].github.io/[repo]<br />
    (This may take like 5min MAX to be online)<br />
    <strong>github pages do not support PHP and other dynamic shit.</strong></p>

    <p>Nothing more required.<br />
	You dont even need to learn <em>html5</em> & <em>css3</em>.<br />
    Well, ok. It's better when you are familiar with <em>html5/css3</em> tags and syntax.<br />
    But, we all start as <strong>noob</strong> dont we ?<br />
    <p>Here's a "Knowledge Center", so you'll be able to learn things here, starting with linux, git, html5/css3, methodology, productivity, cheats & hacks.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why : </p>
    <div class="§"><h3>It's fucking lightweight</h3>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="§"><h3>It's responsive</h3>
        
        <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
    </div>
        
	<div class="§"><h3>It fucking works</h3>
        
        <p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="§"><h3>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h3>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="§"><h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
